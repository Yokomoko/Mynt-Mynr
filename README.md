Welcome to Mynt-Mynr!
==============

Before installing the Mynt Mynr it is advised that you disable your antivirus. This is because it includes mining files that are flagged as false-positive viruses (programs that the antivirus application thinks is a virus but is not). 

###### NOTE: You may need to disable real-time protection from your antivirus to allow your internet browser to download the file.

**It is now advised to add an antivirus exception/exclusion to your install directory. For Windows Defender (Windows 10), go to:**
**Start --> Settings --> Updates and Security --> Windows Defender --> Open Windows Defender Security Center --> Virus and Threat Protection --> Virus & Threat Protection Settings --> Add or Remove Exclusions.**


When you first open the Mynr, you will be greeted with a Starting Guide. This guide will try and find an Electrum installation and get your key. It will also try and detect what type of graphics card you have (NVidia/AMD), if no graphics card is found, it will select CPU mining. There is also a small disclaimer regarding the antivirus as mentioned above.
###### NOTE: If you get an error regarding SlimDX, please close the app and download/install SlimDX which can be found here: https://slimdx.org/download.php (.Net 4.0 x86 version). Direct Link: https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/slimdx/SlimDX%20Runtime%20.NET%204.0%20x86%20(January%202012).msi

Press continue and the main mining window will appear, if it has detected your address and graphics cards correctly, you can press **'Start Mining'**, otherwise enter in these details manually. By default it will mine to the fastest address at Dwarfpool  (due to no sign-up required), but you can change this in the advanced options (**Note: The 'statum+tcp://' part of the custom pool address is not required, but can be entered**).
