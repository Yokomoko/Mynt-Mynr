Welcome to Groestlcoin-Easyminer 2018!
==============

Before installing the Groestlcoin Easyminer it is advised that you disable your antivirus. This is because it includes mining files that are flagged as false-positive viruses (programs that the antivirus application thinks is a virus but is not). 

If you do not already have a wallet in which to store your coins, download the Electrum-GRS wallet from https://www.groestlcoin.org/groestlcoin-electrum-wallet/. If you use the Electrum wallet, the application will automatically detect your address key and mine directly to this. Otherwise you can enter in your own key.

Download and install the latest Easyminer from here: https://github.com/Groestlcoin/Groestlcoin-Easyminer/releases.
###### NOTE: You may need to disable real-time protection from your antivirus to allow your internet browser to download the file.

**It is now advised to add an antivirus exception/exclusion to your install directory. For Windows Defender (Windows 10), go to:**
**Start --> Settings --> Updates and Security --> Windows Defender --> Open Windows Defender Security Center --> Virus and Threat Protection --> Virus & Threat Protection Settings --> Add or Remove Exclusions.**


When you first open the Easyminer, you will be greeted with a Starting Guide. This guide will try and find an Electrum installation and get your key. It will also try and detect what type of graphics card you have (NVidia/AMD), if no graphics card is found, it will select CPU mining. There is also a small disclaimer regarding the antivirus as mentioned above.
###### NOTE: If you get an error regarding SlimDX, please close the app and download/install SlimDX which can be found here: https://slimdx.org/download.php (.Net 4.0 x86 version). Direct Link: https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/slimdx/SlimDX%20Runtime%20.NET%204.0%20x86%20(January%202012).msi

Press continue and the main mining window will appear, if it has detected your address and graphics cards correctly, you can press **'Start Mining'**, otherwise enter in these details manually. By default it will mine to the fastest address at Dwarfpool  (due to no sign-up required), but you can change this in the advanced options (**Note: The 'statum+tcp://' part of the custom pool address is not required, but can be entered**).
